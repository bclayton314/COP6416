Project Summary:
For this project, we implemented the A* heuristic variation of Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm and Prim’s minimum spanning tree algorithm.  For our input we used an adjacency matrix representation of the input graph.  We also compared the use of two different priority queue data structures, a binary min-heap and a linked list, in our implementation.  We used a graphic user interface for both algorithms where the user can switch between the two data structures and add edges between the nodes of the graph.

How to Use the Project

	Which Python packages to install:
		-networkx 
		-matplotlib
		-tkinter
		
	The user will need to type into the terminal: pip install network, pip install matplotlib, and pip install tk
	
	In order to run the program the user will need to run the GUI.py using  the python3 or python command then filename after nativigating to the code/final_code directory from whichever environment they are using.

	The unit test cases are stored in the code/final_code directory under App_Unit_Tests.  Run using python3 App_Unit_Tests.py or python App_Unit_Tests.py

Languages / Packages Used:
	We used Python in Visual Studio Code for our project.  For the GUI and graphs, we used the Python networkx, matplotlib, and tkinter packages.  Networkx and Matplotlib were used to actually create and display the graphs and the tkinter package was used to create and display the GUI.
